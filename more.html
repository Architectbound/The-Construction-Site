        <h1>How We Came to Be</h1>

        <p>
          I, an anonymous teenager with big dreams, started coding this site
          because I had a vision before bed. Stupid? Yes. Cliche? Most
          definitely. But when I came up with this idea I knew it could have
          massive, diverse applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could target the site, in a business setting, to all different
          classes of workers who contribute to the building and furnishing of
          modern homes. And, at the same time, I could target the site to
          teenagers with unlimited imaginations like me.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a couple of weeks, I had it in my head that I could build my own
          house. But I needed a way to visualize it. I couldn’t find a simple,
          non-complex 3D sandbox — so I thought, what if I made one myself?
        </p>

        <p>
          The only problem was that I had no clue how to code. And nobody makes
          it easy. So here we are — learning by building.
